                            Vertigo is a fast-paced top-down shooter where you play as an experimented-on test subject escaping a colossal skyscraper. Fight your way through increasingly difficult floors filled with explosives, guards, police and military units using fast, dual-wield gunplay.</i><br><br>
                            This game was made for school as a final skills demonstration. I worked on this project with 2 other students, I was responsible for doing all the programming in the game ranging from procedural level generation to a data oriented weapon system. I also worked on the game's design.<br><br>
                            The game was made in roughly 3-4 months.

I ended up getting 3rd place and winning an award for this game in the Finnish Game Jam Awards 2024.

                            I've been working on this game with a group of friends ever since it's creation in 2024, I've contributed code, design and animation among other things to the project. I've been helping out swackyGCF (the lead creator of this project and a long time friend of mine) with a little bit of everything ever since he pitched this idea to me all the way back in 2024.<br><br>
